Version 0.1
	- Fix Wolf.getWolf() causes NullPointerException.
	- Fix name duping bug for wolves.
	- Fix load and unload for inventory.
	- Fix load and unload for database. When issue reload command Lupi are no longer able to get information from database.
    - Add configuration nodes. And be sure it's flexible for future changes.
    - Optimize list commands. Add pages.
    - Optimize commands, still throwing errors, maybe cause of database issues but will need to be checked.

Version 0.2
    - Make wolf's pickup items that are not dropped in 1 block from them. Also pickup item when they move, like normal players. (Think we'll need EntityMoveEvent)
    - Add ability for wolves to eat food (pork) from it's inventory when get damaged.
    - Add ability for tamed wolves to have some kind of armor. Like a diamond block in it's inventory.
    - Wolf home. By default set it where the wolf was tamed?
    - Add support for tamed wolves to be teleported to other worlds if player use portal.
    - Add admin commands.
    - Set wolf sit when open inventory and set them stand up when close inventory. (Will need InventoryOpenEvent and InventoryCloseEvent).

Ideas:
    - Add command so owner of a wolf can add peace players that wolf not attack.
    - Add ability for wolves to become "supercharged" and deal twice as much damage for a given time after giving the wolf a special item.
    - Add ability to feed wolves either gunpowder or TNT and create a "kamikazi" effect when that wolf attacks.
    - Add possible alternative to above where wolf drops live TNT and runs away to leave enemy to take damage.
    - When an item is dropped near a wolf. Target that item so wolf will pick it up, if not already have a target.
    - Economy support. Maybe use the Register API.
    - Add wolf shops, so a player can setup a sign and sell one of the tamed wolves. When a player buy a wolf, it's owner changes to the buyer.
    - Add BukkitContrib as a soft dependcy. So users can choose to use it.
    - Add ability to set wolf sitting, or enter other minecart when player enter minecart or other vehicle.
    
    compgurusteve:
    Would anyone want to try to tackle this? I was thinking mainly having a set "pen" the player makes with fences and have it spawn a new 'untamed' wolf only if there were 2 wolves lured inside created pen. Anything additional thoughts?
