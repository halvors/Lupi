TODO
    Version 0.1
        - Add configuration nodes. And be sure it's flexible for future changes.
        - Optimize list commands. Add pages.
        - Optimize database. Let commands load wolf if it's needed. Normal wolves are loaded when their chunk loads.
        - Set wolf sit when open inventory and set them stand up when close inventory.
        
    Version 0.2
    	- Make wolf's pickup items that are not dropped in 1 block from them. Also pickup item when they move, like normal players.
    	- Add ability for wolves to eat food from its inventory when get damaged.
    	- Add ability for tamed wolves to have some kind of armor. Like if a diamond block is in inventory it get's more health.
    	- Wolf home. By default set it where the wolf was tamed?
    	- Add support for tamed wolves to be teleported to other worlds if player use portal.

    Ideas:
        - Add command so owner of a wolf can add peace players that wolf not attack.
        - Add ability for wolves to become "supercharged" and deal twice as much damage for a given time after giving the wolf a special item.
        - Add ability to feed wolves either gunpowder or TNT and create a "kamikazi" effect when that wolf attacks.
        - Add possible alternative to above where wolf drops live TNT and runs away to leave enemy to take damage.
        - When an item is dropped near a wolf. Target that item so wolf will pick it up, if not already have a target.
        - Economy support. Maybe use the Register API.
        - Add wolf shops, so a player can setup a sign and sell one of the tamed wolves. When a player buy a wolf, it's owner changes to the buyer.
        - Add BukkitContrib as a soft dependcy. So users can choose to use it.
